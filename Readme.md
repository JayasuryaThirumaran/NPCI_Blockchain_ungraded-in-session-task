# Introduction and Overview

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about trust and decentralization. One of its most popular applications is smart contracts, which enable programmable, self-executing agreements on platforms like Ethereum. In this exercise, you’ll learn how to build a simple Voting Smart Contract using Solidity, Ethereum's programming language for writing smart contracts. You’ll also explore how to deploy and interact with your contract on Remix, a powerful online Ethereum development environment.
The goal of this exercise is to create a decentralized voting system where participants can:

**Vote for Candidates:** Users can cast their vote for a predefined list of candidates.
**Track Votes:** Check how many votes each candidate has received in real time.
**Prevent Double Voting:** Ensure that no user can vote more than once.
**Administer Elections:** Allow an admin to add candidates.

# Through this exercise, you’ll gain a solid understanding of:

* Writing smart contracts in Solidity.

* Deploying and testing contracts using Remix.

* Using fundamental Solidity concepts such as mappings, modifiers, and events
