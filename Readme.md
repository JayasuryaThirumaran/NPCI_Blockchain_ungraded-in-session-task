# Introduction and Overview

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about trust and decentralization. One of its most popular applications is smart contracts, which enable programmable, self-executing agreements on platforms like Ethereum. In this exercise, you’ll learn how to build a simple Voting Smart Contract using Solidity, Ethereum's programming language for writing smart contracts. You’ll also explore how to deploy and interact with your contract on Remix, a powerful online Ethereum development environment.
The goal of this exercise is to create a decentralized voting system where participants can:

* **Vote for Candidates:** Users can cast their vote for a predefined list of candidates.
* **Track Votes:** Check how many votes each candidate has received in real time.
* **Prevent Double Voting:** Ensure that no user can vote more than once.
* **Administer Elections:** Allow an admin to add candidates.

# Through this exercise, you’ll gain a solid understanding of:

* Writing smart contracts in Solidity.
* Deploying and testing contracts using Remix.
* Using fundamental Solidity concepts such as mappings, modifiers, and events

# What You Will Learn

* Solidity Basics: Understand how to use variables, functions, and control structures.
* Mappings and Structures: Learn to store and manage data in Solidity using mappings and structs.
* Access Control: Use modifiers to restrict certain actions to specific users.
* Event Emission: Implement events to log important activities on the blockchain.
* Testing and Deployment: Gain hands-on experience deploying and interacting with a contract using Remix.

# Exercise Overview

Participants will:

* Write a voting smart contract to allow participants to vote for predefined candidates.
* Learn to deploy the contract and interact with it using Remix.
* Use basic Solidity concepts like mappings, modifiers, and events.
